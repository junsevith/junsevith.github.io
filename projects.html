            <h3>Compiler</h3>
            <p>
              The finale of 5th semester of my studies was making a compiler of simple imperative language. It took me
              a lot of time and a lot of headaches. But after several days of intensive coding I was satisfied enough
              with my code to turn it in.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think I produced some good code, I made an impressive system of handling variables functions and
              operations, I didn't implement all the optimizations I had thought about, but nonetheless I can say that I
              am proud of my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the compiler was written obviously in Rust with help of library for parsing called "lalrpop". The
              compiler was written almost entirely using objective oriented programming, the main work being done by
              several systems with later utilizing the former: first one for handling variables and types in cells of
              RAM, second one handling translation of operations in code into Virtual machine instructions, and third
              one handling functions / procedures, and arithmetic operations, their arguments and return values.
            </p>
            <p>
              What was my surprise when I found out that my compiler placed 1st in the competition in my class! I was
              very happy and proud of myself. I hadnt expected that at all, I was sure that my code was good, but I
              didn't think it was that good.
            </p>

            <h3>Game called Go</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a digital version of the classic board game Go using Java and JavaFX, designed to provide an
              engaging and user-friendly experience. The game supports multiple play modes, including playing against an
              AI opponent, challenging a local player, or competing online with remote opponents. Built with
              object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the code is modular and maintainable, featuring
              well-structured classes for game logic, UI rendering, and player interactions. The AI opponent uses basic
              strategic algorithms to provide a challenging experience for players of different skill levels.

            <h3>Volt and Valve</h3>
            <p>
              My friends and I developed an exciting Minecraft mod using Kotlin for Forge, introducing a fully functional
              electricity system to the game. This mod adds a variety of new machines and tools, including solar panels,
              power cables, batteries, electric furnaces, and electric drills, allowing players to generate, store, and
              use energy in creative ways. Designed with clean and efficient Kotlin code, the mod integrates seamlessly
              with Minecraft’s mechanics while providing a fresh, tech-oriented gameplay experience. Players can build
              complex power grids, automate resource processing, and enhance their survival or creative worlds with
              high-tech upgrades.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond just adding new blocks, our mod emphasizes balance and immersion, ensuring that electricity
              generation and consumption feel rewarding. The electric furnace smelts items faster than vanilla furnaces,
              while the electric drill mines blocks more efficiently—but both require careful power management. Energy can
              be stored in batteries or transmitted through cables to different machines, encouraging strategic base
              design. We also implemented custom UI elements to display energy levels and machine statuses, making the
              system intuitive to use. Whether you're a tech-minded player or just looking for a new challenge, this mod
              brings a whole new layer of depth and innovation to Minecraft!
